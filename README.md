__This project uses [README-Driven Development][RDD]__, and we are in the planning stage. Therefore, what you read below, as of the time of writing, doesn't exist yet. Also check out the [__Project Plan__][Plan]. The actual development starts in 2015. This file will also evolve over time as development progresses.

Should you have any question about the project plan, now is a good time to raise an issue.
