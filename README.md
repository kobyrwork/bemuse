__This project uses [README-Driven Development][RDD]__, and we are in the planning stage. Therefore, what you read below, as of the time of writing, doesn't exist yet. Also check out the [__Project Plan__][Plan]. The actual development starts in 2015. This file will also evolve over time as development progresses.

Should you have any question about the project plan, now is a good time to raise an issue.

Free and open-source web-based BMS simulator, built with the future's web technology.
Play on your computer or on your iPad.

## Features

* Online play
  * comes with some [default selection of songs](https://github.com/bemusic/music).
  * people can host song collections on their own servers too.
* Offline play
  * downloaded simfiles can be played later offline.
  * can also play simfiles on your computer.
* BMS simfile support:
  * 7-keys + Scratch
  * 7-keys
  * 14-keys
  * However, they must be converted into ".bemuse" files first.
* Game modes:
  * Single player mode
  * Two player mode — two players play on the same machine.
* Online start time synchronization — play together with friends.
* Fully supports keysounds.
* Supports `#LNTYPE 1` and `#LNOBJ`.
* Play on PC (using keyboard or gamepad) or on iPad.


## Development


### Project Structure

To make the game load as fast as possible, the app is split into multiple parts:

- __boot__: A special module to display loading bar and loads the application.
  Dependencies should be minimized.
  Code will be inlined into index.html.
- __app__: The game itself.
- __test__: The test code.

### Directory Structure

- __bin__: Miscellaneous shell scripts.
- __config__: Contains application configuration.
- __public__: Contains default HTML and CSS assets.
- __src__: Contains the application source code.
- __tasks__: Contains Gulp tasks.
  - __support__: Contains support code for Gulp tasks.
- __web_modules__: Contains modules that is not convenient to include through npm, such as Jasmine.

These directories are generated by the build tool and is not in repository:

- __coverage__: Contains code coverage data and report.
- __dist__: Contains built code that will be uploaded.


### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Git
- Text Editor with `.editorconfig` Support


### Setup

1. Clone the Git repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `bin/setup` to setup pre-commit hooks and other setup stuff.


### Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

- To run the application, go to `http://localhost:8080/`.
- To run unit tests, go to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/?mode=test`.


### Building

```bash
npm run build
```



### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```



### Bemuse File

BMS files need to be converted into `.bemuse` file format. It is a simple file format to hold BMS files and keysound files together. A custom format is created to be easily consumed by web applications, both on desktop and mobile devices.

* All sound samples are converted into `.mp3`
  * Since it is the only format supported by major browsers!


#### File format draft

* 10 bytes magic string "BEMUSEPACK"
* 4 bytes - metadata size N
* N bytes - metadata in JSON format
  * song metadata
    * title
    * artist
    * genre
    * BPM
    * readme
  * list of all files
    * File name
    * File size
    * File offset (relative to payload start)
  * dependencies
    * list of objects
      * url: relative path to extra `.bemuse` file to load. [^1]
      * type: list of resource types such as "bms", "keysound", "bga"
        * for efficiently loading needed resources
        * for example, dependencies without "bga" type will not be loaded when "bga" feature is turned off (or not implemented :trollface:)
* The payload
  * just a stream of bytes created from multiple files concatenated so that it can be sliced easily.

[^1]: There isn't a simple way to perform partial download of large files. One approach is to split the `.bemuse` file into several parts. Therefore, if the download fails, we don't have to re-download the whole thing.
