Running Your Own Music Server
=============================

.. warning::

    This section is under construction.

Bemuse comes with a default music server to help new players get started.
This default music server contains a selection of songs that I think are really nice.
You can also run your own music server and play it in Bemuse.
This page describes how you can do it.


Prerequisites
-------------

You need to install:

- `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/>`_. The tool is written in JavaScript for Node.js and distributed through npm. That's why Node.js is required.
- `SoX <http://sox.sourceforge.net/>`_. SoX is a tool to process and convert audio files. The tool uses it to convert the sounds into a format suitable for the web.
- For Windows, please also install `qaac <https://sites.google.com/site/qaacpage/>`_. It is a command to convert audio files into MP4 audio (AAC) for browsers that doesn't support OGG.
